            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Even as the Tree is known by its Fruit, ſo are Worſhippers known one from the other; for the good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, but the evil Tree bringeth forth corrupt Fruit; for men do not expect to gather Grapes of Thornes, nor Figs of Thiſtles, neither can any man be a true Worſhipper of God in Spirit, that doth not bring forth Fruits of the Spirit, which are <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, againſt ſuch there is no Law,</hi> Gal. 5.22, 23. for they live in the Spirit and walk in the Spirit with Chriſt, ſuch are the true Worſhippers of God in Spirit and Truth; but ſuch Worſhippers that draw in ſin as an Ox draweth in Water, their beſt Performances in Worſhip, are ſin, unto which the Lord hath no regard; for we know that God heareth not ſinners, but if any man be a true Worſhipper of God, and he doth his will, him he heareth, <hi>John</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59374:35"/>and to wait for the Teachings of Gods holy Spirit, which hath commanded <hi>Silence to all Fleſh before hîm,</hi> Hab. 2.20.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59374:37"/>which comes by Jeſus Chriſt, and through Faith in him, is Life Everlaſting, that is to them, who through Faith have their whole dependance on him, but where men remain in a ſtate of dayly ſining againſt the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſpirit, which all have received, to profit with all, it keeps them ſhort of Gods Grace by Jeſus Chriſt; for the Prayers of the Wicked are ſin, becauſe they remain in ſin, which cauſeth their Prayars to be ſin in the ſight of God, for the Prayers of the wicked are an Abomination before the Lord, and the Sacrifice of the wicked are an Abomination to him, <hi>but the Prayers of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright is his delight,</hi> Pſal. 119.7. Prov. 15.2. ſo it is the Prayers of the Upright in heart, which the Lord accepts and delights in, for unto them is the promiſe of God by Chriſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the Faith of his People, by the power of his ſpirit, which begets the inward man into a lively hope of that aſſurance, which by true Faith the ſoul receives, by true Prayer unto the Lord, through which Prayer by Grace, every Diſpenſation of Gods gifts come to be ſanctified, through the Power of his own ſpirit; for every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is from God, and only ſanctified to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, which receive of the Lords free benefits, and rich Mercies of his Love, in the outward Diſpenſation, which through Prayer and Thanks-giveing, are ſanctified to them which live in Uprightneſs of heart and mind towards God, which the Unrighteous alſo pretend, but it is with unclean Hearts, for which cauſe the Lord will not accept their Prayers, for the Lord only dwells with the pure in heart, whoſe minds are wrought into a true and living ſence of Gods heavenly riches in Jeſus Chriſt, which is the inheritance of his faithfull People, which pray unto him, by the power of his own ſpirit which doth condemn
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59374:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Prayers of all unrighteous men, who pray in their own time, and in their own wills.</p>
               <p>But ſome may then query, Whether the Unrighteous are not commanded to pray? <hi>Anſ.</hi> The hearts of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous deſire the return of the Wicked, that they may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the evil of their way, and ſerve the Lord in Truth and Righteouſneſs, and that the Wicked are to pray, which will not diſcharge any part of their Diſobedience to God, until they come to forſake their Unrighteous way of ſinning againſt the gift of his Grace, and divine Light of his Spirit, which remains their Condemnation for ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. By which it is evident, that the Prayer of a wicked man availeth not before the Lord, that is, while he remaineth in the known Life of Sin, which he prays againſt, but let the wicked forſake their way, and the Unrighteous <hi>Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55 7. So that where men live in known ſins againſt God, and in a belief of its being impoſſible to be free from ſin in this Life, the Prayer of ſuch doth not proceed from the Spirit of God, who hath Commanded his People, not to touch, taſte <hi>nor handle with any unclean thing, but to follow the</hi> leadings of Gods holy Spirit, as the Apoſtles have done for Example, and to mark them which walk otherwayes. So every man and every woman is to ſeek God for themſelves; for he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be found of them that ſeek, him in uprightneſs of heart; and I do not read that any of the Lords ſervants in dayes paſt, were ever lead by the ſpirit of God, to pray either privatly among People in unbelief of ever attaining that which ths Apoſtles prayed for, which is, that they might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59374:38"/>then where in remains the profit of any true Beleivers</hi> Prayer in publick, though in his own family, (which through their unbelief in the power of God, that they ſhall never be free from ſin in this Life, by which they are not as yet of the true Houſhold of Faith) at times and ſeaſons as the ſpirit of God moves in the heart of every ſuch maſter of family, he doth pray, for the return of them, and all other People, which remain in the ſame ſtate of Unbelief, which until they repent and forſake, their prayers will not be accepted of God.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59374:41"/>which proves, that they are not capable of being Diſciples. And in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14, 15, 16. where they bring Chriſts ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> which ſaying is explained in the following Verſe, <hi>that whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child he ſhall not enter therein,</hi> can never reach by Viſible Water, which cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the inſide of theſe wiſe <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine learned Builders,</hi> who ground their unſound Foundation of Sprinkling Infants, in the room of Circumciſion, which according to the holy Scriptures of Truth, one Tipe did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tipe out another, but every Tipe typified the ſubſtance, for Circumciſion was a Tipe or Figure, and cutting off the fore-skin was a Figure of the Circumciſion and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Fore-skin of the heart, Now baptiſm with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a Tipe or Figure, as in <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21. which tiped out the ſpiritual Waſhing or regeneration, which is, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants come in the room of Circumciſion; then how do they agree in a parrellel, ſeeing that the Males were only circumciſed, then why are the Famales now bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, if Baptiſm come in the room of Circumciſion, which as to their form in batpizing, they differ one from the other even as in other things, which they account to be the Ordinances of Chriſt, but are found to be the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of men, ſet up and maintained by the Power of men, who in their ſeveral Forms differ each from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for ſome ſprinkle, others dip, and ſome dip over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; others plunge, others ſprinkle with mixt Water, and to my knowledge ſome have had their Children ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with warm water in cold weather, for which form, ſome of their Prieſts have ſaid to me, that they have allowance for their differing Forms under this Diſpenſation,

From which words ſome do infer, that Infant Baptiſm is of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation.

Now <hi>Adam</hi> is called the Son of God, and he that is a Son of God is alſo a Child of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.38. in whom the Spirit of God by meaſure dwelleth, which is for this end, to direct the mind of Man unto the true and living Knowledge of God; for which end there was a ſufficient gift of God

                  </gap>. and for that end they have received a divine gift of his Spirit of Grace, which doth reveal the Mind and Will of God, in and through the Son of his love, the Lord Jeſus, which is Chriſt (by the divine Life and Light of his Spirit in his People the Hope of Glory, in which ſtate they ſerve the Lord of Life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Revelation of his Spirit, of which all, in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have received, or ſhall receive, <hi>for their Obedience to the Faith,</hi> through which Obedience of Faith, is the <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Life and Salvation,</hi> and <hi>Condemnation</hi> unto them whoſe Diſobedience is to the true Faith, which hath been delivered unto the Saints, unto whom the Lord, in meaſure, doth reveal himſelf in this day, as to his faithful Children in days paſt, it being granted, that God gave extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Revelations, &amp;c. to the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, beſide what he gave them in common with all Saints; for he changeth not, but is the ſame God yeſterday, to day and for evermore, who makes known the Myſtery of Salvation by the Revelation of his good Spirit of Grace, through their Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So now, as the Almighty God hath in all Ages made known of his Will and Mind to the Children of men, by the revealings of his Spirit in their hearts, even ſo is it among his Children in this Day, who behold with their ſpiritual Eyes the mighty Works of God to their Souls, by the Revelations of his Spirit, in and through Jeſus Chriſt;

Theſ. 65</p>
               <p>So here is a drawing by the Spirit, which reveals the Will of God in the Children of his own begetting, thorough which, by Faith, they come into fellowſhip with the Son more and more, <hi>whom no man knoweth but the Father, neither knoweth any the Father, ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> Mat. 11.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then if all divine Revelation and Inſpiration of Gods Spirit to his Children be ceaſed, muſt not all ſpiritual ſeeing and ſpiritual hearing be ceaſed alſo? which by their Doctrines doth ſeem to me, as if they conclude Chriſt alſo to be ceaſed; for if the Inſpiration of Gods holy Spirit of Revelation be ceaſed, then how ſhall God and Chriſt be heard and ſeen ſpiritually, as believers in dayes paſt did ſpiritually hear and ſee him? Alſo if God hath committed his whole

Will they conclude, they all periſh, for want of the Letter, when the Mind and Will of God is, that a Remnant of all Nations, of them that fear him and work Righteouſneſs ſhall be ſaved. And though the holy Scriptures do give Infallible Marks of ſuch an eſtate yet there is no ſcripture can infallibly aſſure any man that he hath theſe marks, but it muſt be the ſpirit of God, that gives every true believer ſuch an aſſurance; <hi>for the ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, Rom.</hi> 8.6.

Then he that is a Servant to ſin, is free from Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; for the wages of ſin is Death, and God is not a God of the Dead, but a God of them that are made alive, by the Power of his Spirit, in and thorough the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe gift of Righteouſneſs is Life eternal, that is, to them that keep cloſe in their minds with the Lord, by which they may not be drawn into the Anti-Chriſtian Faith of any one thing, with which the Devil ſeeks to deſtroy the Soul; for God is not mocked, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men ſome, that they ſhall alſo reap; for he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap Corruption, but he that ſoveth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting, Gal</hi> 6.7.8.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59374:68"/>contained in holy Record, thoroughout the Scriptures of Truth, though ſome have wreſted divers Scriptures, thinking thereby to prove a lawfullneſs of ſaying <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> to more then one, which doth not prove that <hi>you</hi> on <hi>ye</hi> is proper to a ſingle perſon; for thoſe ſcriptures which they have wreſted, do manifeſt, that when the ſpirit of God in his Servants and Meſſengers of his Truth, did ſpeak by the Spirit of Truth, to a Nation, Church or People, it was proper to ſay either <hi>you</hi> or <hi>ye,</hi> or <hi>thou,</hi> which did include a Nation, Church, or People, as one body in the cauſe, which was from the Lord, either for or againſt them, which is not the ſame between man and man, or between man or men, further then the cauſe doth concern a body of People, which in the cauſe are included, as one Man; for as the Body hath many Members, them many Members make but one Body, even ſo is it with a Body of People, whether in Church, or ſtate; the many Members of that Church or ſtate, make but one compleat Body of People, which is very proper to ſay, <hi>thee</hi> or <hi>thou</hi> to that Body of People, but not proper to ſay <hi>thee</hi> or <hi>thou</hi> to a part of them, as they are divided; for though it was proper, according to Truth, to ſay, <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet we never find that the Spirit, of God did direct any to ſay <hi>you</hi> or <hi>ye</hi> to a ſingle <hi>Jew,</hi> nor <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> to more then one, except as aforeſaid, to a Body of People, whom the Spirit of God did as many Members includes one Body.)

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59374:70"/>which if they did, it would then follow, that every true believing Woman is debarred from improving the gift of Gods holy Spirit among his People, which are the Church of Chriſt; for by meaſure is the gift of God, by Jeſus Chriſt, to the Man and Woman alike, wherefore they may pray and prophecy in the Church of Chriſt; for <hi>all may prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.31. So that here is no tye nor bar from believing Womens ſpeaking in the Church of Chriſt, but deparred by them which are not the true Church; <hi>for every Woman that praveth &amp; prophecyeth with her Head uncovered, diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her Head,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.15. By which it is evident, that their Women did in that day ſpeak in the Church; for its of no Edification for any Woman to prophecy alone by her ſelf, but where two or three are gathered together in the Name of the Lord, there will his Spirit be in the midſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For whereas they are not permitted to ſpeak in the Church, it is to be underſtood relating to the Government of the Church, in which they are to keep ſilence, and be under Obedience, as alſo in the Law; for the outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church God hath committed unto men, of which if the Women will learn, they are to ask their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at home; for it is a ſhame for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church, relating to the Government thereof; for in ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59374:71"/>the Man, and the Head of Chriſt is God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. And as to ſuch Women whoſe Husbands are Unbelievers, or that have no husband, a believing Brother hath liberty to inform them in things relating to the Government of the Church; in which the Women Prophets in days paſt, did not rule in the Government of the Church, as may be read of <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Deborah,</hi> who were Propheteſſes in their day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15 20. <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.4 and <hi>Haldah</hi> the Propheteſs, which propheſied of the evil to come upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.22.23. And we read of <hi>Anah</hi> that propheſied concerning Redemption; for it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe coming in that inſtant, gave Thanks likewiſe unto the Lord, and ſpake of him to all them that looked for Redemption in</hi> Jeruſalem; which all that looked for Redemption, did include the whole Church of Chriſt in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and at that inſtant of her coming in, and giving Thanks likewiſe, was, when the Church was gathered together, and Chriſt himſelf at that time in the midſt of his Church in which, at that time, <hi>Anah</hi> the Woman Propheteſs did ſpeak, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.27. to <hi>v.</hi> 0.

By which it appears, that prophecying is not altogether ceaſed among the People of God, whoſe promiſe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue among the faithful, whom he hath called, both Male and Female, to preach the everlaſting Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and by his good ſpirit of Life, Light and Grace are they lead to preach, in order as becometh the Goſpel ſo to do, <hi>that the Prophets may ſpeak two or three, and the others to judge;

Now among ſuch Profeſſors, where theſe things are not in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, according to the Record of the holy Scriptures, which are for Peoples learning, that by the Spirit of God they may follow Chriſt, as the Apoſtles have done for Example, and to mark them which walk other ways; then whom is it that true Believers ſhould mark, but them who pretend to be Goſpel Miniſters, and with their Hearers are not in the holy Practice of the faithful in days paſt, whom they are commanded to follow, as they have followed Chriſt, which until ſuch time as they reform, in obedience to Gods holy Truth, and are found to worſhip him in the Spirit &amp; in the Truth, they are to be marked by all true Believers in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>To have a form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power, who are ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi>

Now Chriſt, the everlaſting Covenant of God to his People, fullfilled all Righteouſneſs under the Law, by which the Covenant of Grace took place, in which the Oath ended, for Chriſt is the Oath of God, and the end of all Oathes, Strife and Contention. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33. to 37.

Plain Doctrine, eaſie to be underſtood, commanded by Chriſt. Not at all to ſwear, or not to Swear at all; there is not a plainer and more ſtrict Command contained in the holy Scriptures of Truth, than for people <hi>Not to Swear at all,</hi> which doth exclude from all manner of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59374:75"/>Oathes, otherwiſe Chriſt would not have mentioned Oathes, which were obſerved in the firſt Covenant of Works under the Law, in which time they were not to forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but to perform their Oathes unto the Lord, which were to be conſcientiouſly performed, according to Truth, in what they were engaged, or had engaged themſelves in Gods Name to do. Now Chriſt, the Oath of God is come, and in him is fullfilled the Righteouſneſs of the Law; for he is the end of all Oathes, Strife and Contention; and the holy Apoſtles followed Chriſts Doctrine, and exhorted People to follow them, as for Enſample they were Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, whoſe Command they obeyed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected People to perform the ſame, and that was, <hi>Above all things not to Swear at all, but to let their Yea be Yea and their Nay, Nay, leſt they fall into Condemnation,</hi> Mat. 5.33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

Now the Apoſtles exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Brethren to obſerve and keep cloſe to the Truth of God, according to the Doctrine of Chriſt, which was, <hi>Not to Swear at all;</hi> which doth manifeſt, by his calling them Brethren, that they whom he exhorted <hi>not to Swear at all,</hi> were Brethren in Covenant with the Apoſtle in the Church of Chriſt elſe why called he them Brethren? then if Brethren with the holy Men of God in the Church of Chriſt, then why ſhould any preſume to ſay, his Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Swearing did only include common Swearing, which it ſo, it muſt then follow, that there vvere common Svvearers in Covenant vvith the holy Apoſtle in the Church of Chriſt, vvhich thing I do not believe, that any common Svvearers vvere in Covenant vvith the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in the Church; but that as they vvere Obſervers of the Oath in the Lavv, he exhorted them to believe in Chriſt, vvho had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs contained in the

What is that old Dragon that came out of Hell, and drew down from Heaven with his Tail, a great part of the Stars of Heaven, but only the Wiſdom of this Tree, which extolls it ſelf againſt God, and places his ſeat with the higeſt? And what elſe are the Thoughts of the Fleſh? What is ſin? what is Arrogance, but the Fruits and Wiſdom of this Tree?

How common is it for men to

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59374:133"/>them, but with the wicked it ſhall go ill.</hi> Therefore ſtudy after Righteouſneſs, and covet after the better part, againſt which, luſt to covetouſneſs, cannot prevail; for luſt to covet after the Riches of this World, is as natural to the Children of men, as the ground is natural to bring forth Weeds; therefore is it, that men by nature, of their own wills, wiſdoms, knowledges, reaſons righteouſneſſes, and the like, will not come under the croſs, to hear and obey <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, to fulfil what the Law required of him to do; ſo alſo are they accurſed which refuſe to hear and obey the Voice of the Son of God, whoſe gift of divine light is the condemnation of every covetous mans thoughts, words and works; ſo that Covetouſneſs is of no profit to any man that gains the riches of this world, with the loſs of his ſoul; <hi>but godl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that provideth not for his own houſe is worſe than an Idfidel, and hath denyed the Faith.</hi> Therefore as God directeth, is my labour to uncloak and lay open this Luſt, Devil and Sin of Covetouſneſs, which abideth in the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59374:133"/>wiſe and prudent of this World, who, through coveting after Money, <hi>the love of which is the root of all evil, in them that will neither enter the Kingdom of Heaven, nor ſuffer others which are entering, to go therein;</hi> which doth manifeſt their Covetouſneſs to exclude all love and fear to God, and all love and pity to their Neighbours good. Nay, what ſin is it, that Covetouſneſs leads men not to commit? it leadeth them that are covetous to oppreſs, cozen, deceive, lye, and ſell their Conſcience for every trifle; alſo, it leads men to turn from the Faith, betray the Truth, ſell it for Money, and to hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs; it leads men to forſake all good Religion, to turn Perſecutors, which is the greateſt Oppreſſion that can be, for it ſweeps away the Life and Eſtate of many men; it leads men to wait as Troops of Robbers, to kill and deſtroy by the conſent of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws, which have been made by covetous Uſurers. And I may ſay, Covetouſneſs not only leads men to kill and ſteal by the high-way, but to rob God of his honour, by ſtealing his words which he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Ones, whoſe words they ſell for Money, each looking for his gain from his Quarter, which if any man refuſe to pay, open war is prepared againſt him; and of this, and the like nature doth Covetouſneſs lead men to ſin againſt God, even to the deſtroying of their peace with him; <hi>for to the Wicked there is no true peace in this life, nor in the Life to come. Covetouſneſs</hi> is one of the chief gates and Inlets to the broad way of <hi>Death, Hell</hi> and <hi>Destruction,</hi> and is ſo delightful and well-pleaſing, that many are led thereby into all manner of Abominations, even to rebel againſt God and King, and to change the form of Worſhip at every change in Government. In ſhort, it leadeth Parents to deſtroy their Children, and Children to deſtroy their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59374:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>Parents; alſo, it leadeth men to lye and ſwear, and to hold the the Truth in unrighteouſneſs, and to pervert the truth, thereby to turn the cauſe of the Fatherleſs and Widdow. Therefore let all men beware of coveting after that which God hath forbidden; for while ſome have beên coveting after Riches, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows, becauſe it is ſuch a ſin, that it draws the ſoul of him that is over much righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, into perdition; for over much righteous before men, is over much wicked in the ſight of God, becauſe its only mans own works, which is plain hypocriſie and deceit, and indeed ſo are all things which are not done by man in truth and ſincerity, with uprightneſs of heart and mind to God, whoſe all-ſeeing eye beholdeth the evil and the good in all men whatever, among whom the heart of ſome that labour to be rich, is pierced through with many ſorrows; for it is written, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into many Temptations, and a Snare, and many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which draw men into perdition;</hi> for luſt to Covetouſneſs, is ſuch a ſubtil Enemy, and the Devils ſnare is ſo cunningly contrived, and ſo full of fair pretences, that let a man be once in love with Money, he knows not which way to wind himſelf out; for it doth ſo bewilder, fetter and entangle his mind, even to the deſtruction of his ſoul, and loſs of body alſo, yet how vehemently with care and diligence, will men vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Covetouſneſs, becauſe that care and diligence there may be, and ought to be, but the truth is, every covetous man makes care and diligence a cloak for Covetouſneſs, whereby he is ſheltered againſt all reproof; in which ſtate mans life among his Neighbours is not much deſireable, neither by the Poor lamented at his Death, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the dividing of his Idol, to whom God hath not
